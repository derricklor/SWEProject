11/18/2021 Solo week
What we need: at least 5 questions per person that are ready to be used for final production

Solo assignments- peer review group, and peer review of other groups SRS

Goal to get 5 questions each by 11/19 check-in: everyone is making progress with their questions

Scanning the SRS so everyone can view the comments

Talking about the implementation of the UI so that it has real functionality

Implementation of increased difficulty through the dungeon: the user will select a specific genre of question (math, history, etc.) and the questions will scale as they progress through the game

 
Next weeks goals: Edit SRS add functionality to our game
